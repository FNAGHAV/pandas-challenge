# School District Analysis
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of the school district's key metrics. Calculations included various performance indicators such as average scores, passing percentages, and overall performance for both the district and individual schools.

# District Summary
The district summary provided an overview of key metrics:

Total number of unique schools
Total students
Total budget
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage passing math
Percentage passing reading
Overall passing percentage (students passing both math and reading)

# School Summary
The school summary broke down key metrics for each individual school:

School name
School type
Total students
Total school budget
Per student budget
Average math score
Average reading score
Percentage passing math
Percentage passing reading
Overall passing percentage
Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
The top-performing schools were identified by sorting schools based on the overall passing percentage in descending order.

# Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
The lowest-performing schools were identified by sorting schools based on the overall passing percentage in ascending order.

# Math Scores by Grade
This section provided a DataFrame listing the average math scores for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

# Reading Scores by Grade
A DataFrame was created to list the average reading scores for students in each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

# Scores by School Spending
A table was generated to break down school performance based on average spending ranges per student. Four bins with reasonable cutoff values were used to group schools by spending.

# Scores by School Size
A DataFrame was created to break down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

# Scores by School Type
A table was generated to show school performance based on the "School Type."

# Implementation Details
The analysis was implemented in Python using the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
The code was structured into sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of the analysis.
Data was read from a CSV file containing relevant information about schools and students.
