PyCitySchools Challenge - Report

Summary of Analysis:
The analysis delved into various metrics related to school performance in the PyCity School District, covering district and school-level summaries, top-performing and bottom-performing schools, average math and reading scores by grade, and the influence of school spending, size, and type on academic performance.
District Summary:
Total Number of Schools: The district comprises 15 schools, identified using len(data.unique()).
Total Students: The academic dynamics involve 39,170 students, revealed by .count().
Total Budget: The cumulative budget for all schools exceeds $24.6 million, uncovered using .sum().
Average Math Score: The district-wide average math score stands at 78.99, calculated using .mean().
Average Reading Score: The district-wide average reading score is 81.88, determined by .mean().
Math Passing Rate: Approximately 74.98% of students achieved passing scores in math.
Reading Passing Rate: A higher proportion, 85.81%, achieved passing scores in reading.
Overall Passing Rate: Combining math and reading performance results in an overall passing rate of 65.17%.
School Summary:
The detailed analysis includes school-specific information on type, total students, total school budget, budget per student, average math and reading scores, passing math and reading percentages, and overall passing percentage. The data reveals variations in student numbers, budgets, and scores among schools, with notable trends in math performance.
Top and Bottom Performing Schools:
Top Five: The top-performing schools, based on overall passing percentage, are charter schools: Cabrera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson, and Pena.
Bottom Five: District schools, including Rodriguez, Figueroa, Huang, Johnson, and Ford, rank as the bottom-performing based on overall passing percentage.
Scores by School Spending:
The impact of budget per student on academic performance is analyzed using spending bins. Schools with a budget per student below $585 outperform others, with a gradual decline in performance as spending per student increases.
Scores by School Size:
Schools are categorized by size (small, medium, large) to assess the relationship between school size and academic outcomes. Small-sized schools outperform both medium and large-sized schools, with large-sized schools exhibiting the lowest overall passing percentage.
Scores by School Type:
Comparing charter and district schools reveals consistent superiority in academic performance for charter schools across all metrics.
Conclusions:
Impact of School Size:
Smaller schools demonstrate higher overall passing percentages compared to larger schools.
Schools with fewer students showcase superior academic performance.
School Type and Academic Performance:
Charter schools consistently outperform district schools in average scores and passing rates.
The type of school significantly influences student success.
These conclusions highlight the need for further exploration into factors contributing to the success of smaller schools and charter schools. The findings can inform policy decisions aimed at enhancing academic outcomes in the PyCity School District.
